FRONTEND  -  MIDDLE-END  -  BACK-END
-We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
-Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make discussion that which microservice
should actually rspond to the this request
-We can do message validation, responds transformation, rate limiting
-We try to prepare an Api gateway that acts as this middle end.
